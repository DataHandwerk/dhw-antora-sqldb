// tag::description[]
* the documentation contains diagrams. These diagrams are defined using https://plantuml.com/[plantUML]
** export procedure: xref:docs.usp_antoraexport_objectpuml.adoc[]
* current implementation
** Puml diagrams are not exported as individual files but they are included into the the page content where they are required
** This significantly improves the performance of the Antora export, since fewer files need to be exported.
* obsolete implementation
** individual diagrams per object are exported into (AntoraModuleFolder)``/``(AntoraModuleName)``/partials/puml/``
